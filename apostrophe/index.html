                    One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the <span>’</span> 
                    for possession. Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case <span>’</span> 
                    has a gentle tender insinuation that makes <span>’</span> 
                    very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and from time to time I put <span>’</span>
                    in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like <span>’</span> 
                    and leaving <span>’</span> 
                    out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps <span>’</span> 
                    does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting <br><span>’</span>  
                    alone if <span>’</span> 
                    has come in and sometimes <span>’</span> 
                    has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let <span>’</span> 
                    come in.
